        <div class="question">Q1. What is a paradigm?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            A programming paradigm is a fundamental style or approach to structuring and organizing code. It represents a way of thinking about and solving programming problems.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="question">Q2. What types of paradigms do you know?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            There are several major programming paradigms:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Procedural Programming:</strong> Focuses on procedures or functions that operate on data</li>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> Organizes code into objects that contain both data and behavior</li>
                <li><strong>Functional Programming:</strong> Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions</li>
                <li><strong>Logical Programming:</strong> Based on formal logic and used for rule-based reasoning</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="question">Q3. What is OOP?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. It allows us to model software as a collection of cooperating objects, each with its own attributes and behaviors.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="question">Q4. What does "object" refer to?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            In Object-Oriented Programming, an object is an instance of a class. It's a self-contained component that combines:
            <ul>
                <li>Properties (attributes/data)</li>
                <li>Methods (behaviors/functions)</li>
            </ul>
            Objects represent real-world entities and encapsulate both state and behavior in a single unit.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="question">Q6. Did u do a research about the concept of oop before the course</div>
        <div class="answer">
            
            OOP organizes code into objects (with attributes and methods). Key principles:
            <ul>
                <li>Encapsulation: Hides details, exposing only necessary parts</li>
                <li>Abstraction: Simplifies complex systems by showing only essential features</li>
                <li>Inheritance: Allows new classes to inherit properties and behaviors from existing ones</li>
                <li>Polymorphism: Lets different classes use the same method name but behave differently</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
